# Notes about WWIVnet-FTN

- The WWIVnet-FTN hub is running D'Bridge.  D'Bridge uses the same
  password for ```Binkp Session Password``` as the 
  ```Packet Password```. I can make them different, but when a 
  Session Password is set - it will also set the Packet Password
  (will use the same PW).
- The destination BinkP port for my D'Bridge hub is ```24555```
  (as noted in the Nodelist).
- The Current Nodelist is available from:
  [https://github.com/wwivbbs/wwivnet/tree/master/wwivnet](https://github.com/wwivbbs/wwivnet/tree/master/wwivnet)
- Please use wwivftn for the domain name when creating the network to
  avoid MD5 CRAM session PW issues.
- To submit the application, please log into my BBS 
  (bbs.weather-station.org) and email me the application or 
  Internet email to:
  [mark@weather-station.org](mailto:mark@weather-station.org)
